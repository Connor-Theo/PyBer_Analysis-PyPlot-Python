# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
My analysis for the ride-sharing app of Pyber was tasked with creating summary data-frames based on data from different city types: (rural, urban, suburban) and then using graphical features within Pandas to visualize and compare the data for Pyber executives. Our data primarily focused on the number of drivers (per city type), number of riders/users (per city type), and the fares (per city type). We took the aggregates, as well as the averages of these three key data series to support the analysis.

## Results
The results of the analysis were different my initial expectations when I was first tasked with the question, “how does the data compare?”  What I gathered from the data frames was that on average the cost per ride, and the fare per driver was higher in Rural locations than it was for any city type! This struct me as odd because with the sheer volume of major cities, or more densely populated areas we could expect rates to be slightly higher on average due to surge charges and other factors, However, the results showed us the complete opposite with Urban areas being the cheapest.  I have attached both the data frame and the chart below for clearer visualization.

## Summary
To summarize the results of my analysis we can expect to see less drivers and less riders in rural locations, but that also comes with higher prices on average per ride and per driver.  These results were not my first thoughts heading into this, but looking at the data this would make sense, I could have just as easily seen Urban locations being the most expensive on average.
